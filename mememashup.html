<p>The following meme mashup, I have to give credit for my friend coming up with a great idea on choosing the images that I should use for my meme mashup. Tackling this on photoshop was a little tricky, due to having to paint, erase, and re-edit some of the things, to arrange it to how I wanted it to look like. I put random images, to make it look more realistic as to the reactions of how people would look at someone, well if they accidentally sat on the cake or made an accident. I used PhotoShop for this and the images I found on google; mostly vectors, and the famous "cat meme".</p>
